# transfer-learning-on-image-food-classification

This code outlines the process of building and fine-tuning a deep learning model using TensorFlow, particularly focusing on transfer learning with the EfficientNetB0 architecture. The goal is to classify food images from the Food101 dataset using only 10% of the available data, aiming to outperform the original Food101 paper.

### Key Components:
1. **Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**: The model starts with feature extraction using EfficientNetB0, then fine-tunes the top layers after freezing most of the pre-trained layers. This is a classic transfer learning strategy, where a pre-trained model is adapted to a new task with minimal data.
2. **Data Augmentation**: To make the most of the limited data, the code incorporates data augmentation (e.g., random flips, rotations, zooms) directly into the model.
3. **Model Checkpointing**: The code saves the best model weights during training to prevent overfitting and ensure the best-performing model is used.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The code also includes a helpful function to visualize predictions and identify incorrect predictions.
5. **Visualization**: The code concludes with methods to visualize the model's predictions on random images, as well as plotting the F1-scores for each class, making it easier to interpret the model's performance across different categories.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Code Organization**: The code could benefit from being modularized into functions for better readability and reusability. For example, the training, evaluation, and visualization sections could each be encapsulated in separate functions.
- **Commenting**: Although there are some comments, more detailed explanations about certain sections, like why specific learning rates were chosen or the significance of certain callbacks, would help clarify the decision-making process.
- **Error Handling**: Adding error handling for situations where data might be missing or improperly formatted would make the code more robust, especially when dealing with real-world datasets.

Overall, this code provides a solid foundation for using transfer learning to solve image classification problems with limited data and includes useful techniques like data augmentation and model fine-tuning.
